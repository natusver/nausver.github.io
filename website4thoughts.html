        <h3></h3>
        <p class="quote">For one must die to be born again</p>

        <h3>On environment</h3>
        <p class="quote">A person is nothing more than the sum of his environment, and whoever says the opposite is a victim of it</p>

        <h3>On freedom</h3>
        <p class="quote">Visualized purpose <br> A glimmer of hope <br> The happiness felt <br> When one thinks of sacrifice</p>
        <p class="quote">Sacrifice for love <br> For passion that ignites <br> The senses into action <br> That is freedom</p>

        <h3></h3>
        
        <h3>The Great Union</h3>
        <p class="quote">When the world looks at us as heavenly creatures, we will laugh at our flaws, smile at our imperfections. We will build according to Nature's will: the law of equilibrium--that every struggle has an equal expression. So that within our capacity we may express our struggles in systems that may have the greatest benefit to humanity. And Nature will embrace us for propogating it's mission until the roots of trees engulf our souls. For mimicking nature is the surest way to spend eternity with the Mother of All.</p>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p class="quote">The foundation to every optimal decision is a complete data set. A complete data set is so pure, so elegant, a perfect match to the physical world.</p>

        <h3>On failure</h3>
        <p class="quote">One should examine their actions to such extreme; so the small may appear large. How do you find variation among input variables? Square them. Internally amplifying failure to this same degree catches minor deviations and brings them to the forefront of consciousness with a splash of orange, fluorescent green. Let thy haunt thy soul until the lessons have been consumed like a homeless man feasting on his weekly bread.</p>
